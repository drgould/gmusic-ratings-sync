gmusic-ratings-sync: Sync your iTunes song ratings with Google Music
====================================================================

Pretty much exactly what it sounds like:

1.	Point it at your "iTunes Library.xml" file
2.	Provide your Google Music credentials
3.	...?
4.	Profit!

*NOTE*:
	This only syncs ratings from iTunes to Google Music and will overwrite any ratings you've set in Google Music. Also, it assumes you're using 5-star ratings (because thumbs up/down is just not sufficient for rating music).
